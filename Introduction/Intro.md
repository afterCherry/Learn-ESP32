# Feature and IDF
The ESP32 is a low-powered processor made by Espressis, with rich features you can leverage to create your own successful projects.
The IDF stands for the "Internet-of-Things DevelopmentFramework", which is the basis for the ESP32 Arduino, and you can see
from https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/index.html, it is the espressif's official framework for 
creating IOT projects. 


#  Suggested Experience
- C Programming Language 
- Arduino

# Dev Boards
- actual chip, which is called a WROOM. It's a pretty popular chip, it's pretty cheap, and it can do a lot of stuff.
It's got four merges of RAM built inside and the ESP32
- memory, wireless antenna, serial communication interface, USB input...
- regulator, which takes the 5 volts coming in from the USB and drops it down to 3.3 volts, which will then power the chip
- peripheral(I/O pins)
- PSAM(Psuedo Static RAM), which has advantages instorage and speed
